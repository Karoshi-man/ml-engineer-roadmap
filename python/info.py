# python is dynamically type-checked and garbage-collected

# supports structured, object-oriented and functional programming

# it uses dynamic name resolution (late binding)

# import this -> write this and compile :)
# Zen of python (PEP 20)

# Python basics:
    # vars, data types, operators, control flow statements

# Functions:
    # positional and keyword arguments, default values, lambda, *args, **kwargs

# OOP:
    # classes, obejcts, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation

# Data structures:
    # lists, tuples, dicts, sets, collections module utilities

# Error handling:
    # try/except block, custom exceptions, finally clauses

# File handling:
    # file reading and writing, context managers, pathlib support

# Modules and packages:
    # import system, virtual env, package management with pip

# Functional programming;
    # filter, map, reduce, list comprehensions, dicts, sets, generator expressions

# Iterators and generators:
    # iterators, yield statements, lazy evaluation

# Decorators:
    # function wrapping, metadata preservation, parameterized decorators

# Context managers:
    # with, enter and exit methods, contextlib utilities

# Typing and type hints:
    # static type annotations, typing module, mypy support

# Async programming:
    # async/await, event loops, tasks, coroutines

# Testing:
    # unittest, pytest, fixtures, mocking tools

# Standard library:
    # os, sys, datetime, itertools, functools, subprocess modules



# In python all - is object.

# Python files treated by default as encoded UTF-8

# CPython

# PVM

# Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)

# Every object in python lives in heap 
    # and vars are just references to objects

# Dunder methods and meta programming

# Memory managmentt in python is via refcounting

# __slots__

# weakref

# Descriptors - @

# Interning in Python

# Bytecode and dis module
